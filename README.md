# Stash Finder

A simple utility to help you sift through a recently acquired hoarding stash
and move your precious hoarded files into a more organized directory.

This tool was designed with data hoarders in mind.


## Why VB6

TLDR: Nostalgia.

Well, I really wanted to have some fun using this ancient piece of software,
and since I pretty much think I'm going to be the only one using this program
I didn't mind the fact that it's old and ugly.

Also I've always wanted to write a complete application using VB6 instead of
those horrible programs I wrote back in 2007 with it.
